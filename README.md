# Predicting-housing-price-using-linear-regression-and-CART</br>
In this project linear model and CART is fitted for housing data to predict median price</br>
</br>
About the data:</br>
housing dataset is taken for this project. In the dataset median price is the dependant variable and 13 predictor variables are there
The data is clean</br> 
</br>
Methodology:</br>
1. Stepwise linear model is applied to fit the model with appropriate features</br>
2. CART model is fitted on the dataset </br>
3. On the out of sample, SSE is measured to evaluate the performance</br>
</br>
Results:</br>
Out of sample SSE for linear model is 17.30 whereas out of sample SSE for regression tree is 10.93.Hence, CART is better for this case.
