# Predicting-housing-price-using-linear-regression-and-CART
In this project linear model and CART is fitted for housing data to predict median price

About the data:
housing dataset is taken for this project. In the dataset median price is the dependant variable and 13 predictor variables are there
The data is clean 

Methodology:
1. Stepwise linear model is applied to fit the model with appropriate features
2. CART model is fitted on the dataset 
3. On the out of sample, SSE is measured to evaluate the performance

Results:
Out of sample SSE for linear model is 17.30 whereas out of sample SSE for regression tree is 10.93 . 
Hence, CART is better for this case.
